[Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-canvas) · [Source](https://github.com/pooriaarab/agentic-canvas) · [Support](https://github.com/pooriaarab/agentic-canvas/issues)

A shared whiteboard for diagrams, drawn by people and agents.

> Status: early. Only the board model works. It is not on npm yet. The CLI, the
> MCP server, the HTTP API, and the web UI are not built yet.

## Install

Not on npm yet. Build from source:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

## Quick start

```ts
import { Board } from "agentic-canvas";

const me = { kind: "human", id: "ada" } as const;
const bot = { kind: "agent_of_human", id: "helper" } as const;

const board = new Board();
board.addShape({ id: "a", type: "rect", x: 0, y: 0, text: "Start" }, me);
board.addShape({ id: "b", type: "diamond", x: 240, y: 0, text: "Ok?" }, bot);
board.addConnector({ from: { id: "a" }, to: { id: "b" }, text: "next" }, bot);
board.list(); // every element, back to front
```

## Features

- Shapes: rectangle, ellipse, diamond, text, sticky note, frame, image.
- Connectors that bind to shapes and follow them when they move.
- Z-order, and groups that nest.
- Every element keeps the kind of its author and of its last editor. An agent
  edit stays visible as machine-made.
- Yjs underneath: two copies of a board merge without conflicts.
- No UI code. The model runs in Node and in a Worker.

## Limits

- A board holds at most 10,000 elements.
- Images hold a `data:` PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP, or a `blob:` key. Remote URLs and
  SVG are refused.
- Two peers that make the same explicit id at the same time keep only one element, with no
  error. Explicit ids are safe with one writer. Leave `id` empty and the board picks a random one.
- Delete against connect can leave a connector with a missing end. Readers hide it. `repair()`
  removes it, and `Board.decode` runs `repair()` for you.
- `move` writes absolute positions. Two peers that move one shape at the same time do not add up:
  the last writer wins.
- Frames are plain shapes. They do not own the shapes inside them yet.
- Delete leaves no audit record yet. The caller logs it.
